# Contributing to Limelight

Looking to contribute something to Limelight? Here's how you can help.

## Quick start
We only accept issues that are bug reports, or feature requests. Bugs must be isolated and reproducible problems that we can fix within the Limelight core.

- [Request a new feature](https://github.com/GrishonNganga/Limelight/issues/new)
- [Submit a bug report](https://github.com/GrishonNganga/Limelight/issues/new)
  
## Key branches
``master``  is the latest, deployed version

## Pull requests
Pull requests that do not solve an existing issue are essentially un-prioritized – don't expect these to be addressed quickly  – at the moment.

The files in this repository are generated elsewhere and we **do not** merge PR's directly into master.

Try not to pollute your pull request with **unintended** changes – keep them simple, small and specific.

Try to share which browsers your code has been tested in before submitting a pull request
